# Segmentaion
Opencv's binary segmentation
This code reads an input image, converts it to grayscale, and performs thresholding to create a binary image. It then performs morphological operations to remove noise and fill in holes in the binary image. The resulting binary image is saved to a file. This is just one example of how binary segmentation can be performed in Python using OpenCV. There are many other ways to achieve this, and the specific steps and algorithms used may vary depending on the application.
